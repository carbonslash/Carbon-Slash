# Your Main Title (Matches Front Matter Title)

## 📌 Introduction and Context Setting

Begin your article here. Hook the reader with a strong, timely statement about the core problem or opportunity your article addresses. Keep paragraphs short and use **bold text** to emphasize key concepts.

***

## 🔎 Section 1: The Problem or Core Thesis

Use headings (`##`) to break up your content. This section should deep dive into the 'why'—why is this topic important right now?

* Use bullet points for easy-to-digest lists.
* This improves readability.

### Subsection 1.1: Detailed Analysis

Use sub-headings (`###`) for specific data points or detailed steps.

> Use blockquotes for highlighting important notes, statistics, or quotes from experts or source material.

## 💡 Section 2: The Solution or Opportunity

Pivot the narrative here. If you introduced a problem (like load shedding), this section shows the path forward (like decentralized solar). This is where you bring value to the reader.

You can use standard Markdown formatting:
* A link to an external source: `[Source Link](https://www.example.com)`
* A numbered list of steps:
    1.  Step one is easy.
    2.  Step two requires commitment.
    3.  Step three yields results.

## 🔮 Conclusion: Summary and Forward Look

Briefly summarize your main findings without introducing new information. End with a strong closing thought or a call to action (e.g., a challenge to the industry, a recommendation for policy).

### 🏷️ Final Check (Before Pushing)

1.  **Date:** Is the `date:` in the past (to show up on `localhost`)?
2.  **Image:** Does the `image:` path work?
3.  **Excerpt:** Is the `excerpt:` written to compel a click?
4.  **Draft:** Is `draft: false`?
